Produced in post-war conditions, it only included illustrations of a few inscriptions, although very many of them had been photographed; and it only offered limited geographic information. The purposes of this enhanced reissue are, therefore, to make the original material available again, and to provide the full photographic record, together with geographical data linking the inscriptions to maps and gazetteers, and so to other resources. Electronic publication makes this possible, and also allows us to offer greater functionality, such as free text searches.

Such inscriptions -- like papyri and graffiti -- are particularly precious as they provide rare evidence for writing features and their spread in Late Antiquity.

From such substantial groups of documents, written or at least deposited in the same place, we can recover much information about the traditions of writing curse tablets (see Creating the curse - writing the curse), the rituals that accompanied the inscribing of curses and the context in which people thought it appropriate to create their curses, potentially a stigmatised activity because of its magical associations (see People, goods and gods - the workings of magic).',Oxford University,1976, '',Great Britain,0.0,0.0,http://curses.csad.ox.ac.uk/, '', '','','1','0','0','0'
